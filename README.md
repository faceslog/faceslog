## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**Careful** Some people were just copy pasting my code or using my code as decoy to spread their malware, cheats and more. Some of them used my domain name (faceslog.com) as decoy in their malware code. Even if I reported these repositories to GitHub support they didn't care and did nothing to delete those. Since then I moved to Gitlab. Support is better, almost all needed features are free. 

My Gitlab: [https://gitlab.com/faceslog](https://gitlab.com/faceslog)

I will keep Github for forks and to contribute to open source projects.

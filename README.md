CS Student fighting for online privacy ðŸ”’ Loving Software Development, Reverse Engineering, Anti-Cheat âš™ & Photography !

I do love programming in C++, Java, NodeJS, Golang and I'm planning to learn Rust. As you know Programming languages are only a tool to implement algorithms so I guess I could use anything that fits best a project.

Feel free to contact me by using my website ðŸ˜Š.

**Careful** Some people used some of my code and domain name (faceslog.com) as decoy to spread their malware, cheats and more. Even if I reported these repositories to GitHub some may be uploaded again.

As a computer science student, I have always been passionate about technology and the endless possibilities it offers. However, I have also become increasingly aware of the importance of privacy in the digital age. üîí That's why I try to self-host as many apps as possible. 

It allows me to have a much better control over my data and ensures that it is not being collected or sold to third parties without my consent. It may take a bit more effort and technical know-how, but the peace of mind and security it provides is worth it. I also hope to use my skills and knowledge to develop and contribute to privacy-focused software that can help others protect their personal information as well.

I also have a strong interest in reverse engineering, malware analysis, and cybersecurity. I love the challenge of deconstructing and understanding how systems work, and finding ways to protect them from malicious attacks. I am constantly striving to learn more and stay up to date on the latest developments in these fields.

I am well aware that there is always more to learn and that I have much room for improvement. I am constantly seeking out new opportunities to learn and grow as a developer, and I am always open to suggestions and guidance from others. Whether it's through coursework, online learning, or hands-on projects, I am dedicated to expanding my knowledge and skills in the field of computer science. If anyone has any suggestions or resources that they think would be helpful for me or my projects, I am all ears !

I'm happy to help those who are just starting out in the field of self-hosting and are looking for guidance and support.
